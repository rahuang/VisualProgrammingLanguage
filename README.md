15-112 TermProject - Visual Programming Language

**Created By**: Richard Huang

This was my 15-112 Term Project that I created my first semester at Carnegie Mellon University. My goal for this project was targeted towards beginners in programming and to help them understand key concepts of computer science and programming without worrying much about syntax. I've built this UI for users to drag and drop different programming elements like print, if statements, loop, etc. and create functions and programs. Users can then convert the visual code into Python to see how their code would look and then actually run the code as well!
